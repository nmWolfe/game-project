# Super-Maize Man - A web-based maze game!

This project was a whole field of fun. It involves creating a web-based game that can handle user input, and provide some sort of challenge for the Maize-loving human who decides to play it.
It was designed with mobile-in-mind, so there is the option to click your way through with on-screen buttons, or alternatively use directional inputs on your desktop computer.

This project has helped to cement my knowledge of Typescript, along with reaffirming my abilities styling with SCSS, and of course semantic HTML.

## Features

1. Directional Inputs

   - The game takes directional input from the usual direction keys, and also WSAD.
   - The game has a directional keypad that will hide when a bigger (desktop) screen size is detected.

2. Mobile-first Design

   - This game was developed with a mobile-first mindset, meaning it will look particularly good on a handheld device.
   - Includes optional landscape mode.

3. Desktop Mode

   - When the game is played on a Desktop, or screen wider than 1200px, it will hide the mobile-keypad, and accept keyboard inputs only.

## So, how can I play this game?

The game is hosted on Github Pages, and if you click [here](url) it will take you to the page.
