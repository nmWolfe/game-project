Well,  I agree. <br>
But this isn't about me, it's about you! <br>
You are a Corn person who loves gathering corn.
<br> Your task is to collect all the delicious corns before the timer runs out. <br>
If the timer runs out, goodbye my sweet friend, I'll see you in the theatres. <br>

 I can honestly say I have never seen anyone complete this game. <br>
 Its immense difficulty stumped even me, <br> 
 The King of the Corn! <br>
 I guess I will have to renounce my title and pass it on to you, brave corn-collector. <br>
