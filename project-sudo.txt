Game ideas 
    - Celeste / SuperMeatBoy / Hollow Knight / platform-er / rogue-lite? 
    - fixed position? Sticky walls? 
    - Will P/C be single move? i.e fly one direction, stick to wall for certain period, fall. 
        - If above - make floor = dead? 
    - Will P/C have option to direct jump? 
        - Could look at adding in a line showing direction? 
    - Possibly be easier to work on X and Y = left, right, up, down
    - What is the 'goal' of the game? 
        - Reach a certain point? 
        - Collectibles along route? 
    - Puzzler? Always a correct solution? 

Level design
    - scrolling? 
        - Could keep fixed and add scroll effect on level progression? 
    - Backgrounds? 
        -  Hand drawn? Random? AI-generated? 
        - Pixel backgrounds 
    - How will ypu implement obstacles? 
        - death-traps? 
        - spikes? 
        - non-stick walls? 
    - How will you make P/C stick to walls? 
        - Delay? 
        - Will this require gravity effect? 
    - Size of container? 
        - Definitely use wrapper and keep window to a certain size. 
        - Force mobile into landscape to play? 
            - Optional landscape? 
        - Possibly make game smaller for mobile? 
    - Start and End points
        - pass through 'open' area to get to next stage? 
        - land in certain spot to get to next page? 
    - Un-lockable areas? Impassable areas? 
    - Zero-G rooms? 

Player Character
    - Icon? Object? What will it be? 
    - Simple up / down / left / right controls? 
    - How will the control transform itself to mobile? 
        - How to implement a 'swipe' feature for directions.
        - left right up down on screen? 
            - Option to switch this depending on dominant hand? 
    - Look into distance arrows? Pull and shoot? 

Movement 
    - end to end? 
    - Increment? 
    - Jumps? No jumps? 

Display 
    - 

Enemies
    - Possibly implement math.random to fire something in a random direction in a room, that will wipe p/c out? 

Theme
    - Dark Souls meets Super Meat Boy meets Celeste
    - GORE / BLOOD / VIOLENCE? 
    - Pixel pixel pixel 

Progression
    - Rogue-lite? Rewards to make runs easier? 
    - If die too many times, give option for easy-mode? 
    - Maybe look into auto-generated rooms?
    - Bosses? 

Easter Eggs
    - easy mode option? 
    - 'developer room' - info about me? 
    - cheat codes? - up up up down down down or something... 

Handlers 
    - Handle Inputs 
        - left, right, up, down
    - Handle Location
        - Handle the player Location
    - Handle obstacles
        - traps / resets 
    - Handle gravity
        - Zero zones? Usual weight? 
    - Handle Levels 
        - Completed Levels
        - Switching between levels 
    
Functions
    - Taking directional Inputs
    - Moving character after inputs 
    - level control 
    - position relatives? 
    - image rendering 


Game Logic
    - p/c can move up/down/left/right 
    - Will always be only 1 path to exit
    - Single column / row pathways 
    - end to end movement. If a direction is pressed, p/c will travel that paths extent 
    - 

Step 1 - Figure out how to render a movable object on a page
Step 2 - Figure out how to move said object
Step 3 - Figure out how to have walls 
Step 4 - Figure out how to have resets 
Step 5 - 


Possibly think - traversing matrixes
Only allow one end to the other 
Think about how to transverse the thing, and how to make it display on screen. 

SUPER MAIZE BOY - CORN JOKESSSSS
PLAY KORN SON FREAK ON A LEASH AT SOME POINT

maybe start out as snake esque? go into maze? go into side scroller? 

Put a timer on - when it 'gets too hot' go pop - turn into popcorn
